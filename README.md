# SEIR 621 Polyglot Challenge

As you continue on your journey studying and working with code, it is essential for you to take your existing knowledge and build up on your skills on new things.

Remember, the languages and frameworks that we use are constantly changing, and if you are not able to build up on your existing skills into something new, you will be doing yourself a disservice when you get into the job application process.

For this activity, lets take a few code challenges that we are familiar with in Javascript, and try them out in our new language, Python

You should already know the steps required for these challenges, and the different parts involved (Looping, conditionals, mathematic operators, string concatination...). What is going to be most important in this is the ability to translate your already existing skills into a new language. Because if you can translate your basic JS to Python, you will be able to use these same skills to learn Ruby, Java, Rust, or any of the other many, many languages out there that you will see in the wild.
